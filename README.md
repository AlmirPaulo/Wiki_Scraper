# Wiki Scraper
A script to scrap wikipedia articles in ".txt" files easy and quickly, built in Python with a GUI. 

## Requirements
In order to run this script, you need Python and all the other requirements mentioned in "requirements.txt" file. It's  recomended to install this on a virtual environment. 
## F.A.Q.
1. **Where is the GUI?**
I will work on that matter.

2. **Why I can't scrap that page?**
This script only works for wikipedia articles and it totally respects the rules of wikipedia "robots.txt" file. 

3. **Why it takes so long to scrap?**
It's not sooo long... it's just 10 seconds. And, again, it's to respect the rules of wikipedia "robots.txt" file. 

4. **Why I would scrap Wikipedia articles in ".txt" files if I can just copy and paste?**
Well, this script let you save multiple scraps in the same file (if it's an advantage for you). I think it's also easier and coller this way.
