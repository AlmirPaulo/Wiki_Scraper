## Download and Install
If you are in a **Linux** system download the .deb file <a href="https://github.com/AlmirPaulo/Wiki_Scraper/raw/main/Wiki%20Scraper.deb" download>here</a>. But if you are in a **Windows** system, hold on! I'm working in your .exe file.
## Q&A

1. **Why I can't scrap that page?**

This software  only works for wikipedia articles and it totally respects the rules of wikipedia "robots.txt" file. 

2. **Why it takes so long to scrap?**

It's not sooo long... it's just 10 seconds. And, again, it's to respect the rules of wikipedia "robots.txt" file. 

3. **I find a bug!**

Let me know! Feel free to open an Issue here on Github.
