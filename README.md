## Q&A

1. **Why I can't scrap that page?**

This software  only works for wikipedia articles and it totally respects the rules of wikipedia "robots.txt" file. 

2. **Why it takes so long to scrap?**

It's not sooo long... it's just 10 seconds. And, again, it's to respect the rules of wikipedia "robots.txt" file.
